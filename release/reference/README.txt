This datapack/resourcepack pair was automatically generated by a cool desktop app that lets you add any number
of new music discs to vanilla Minecraft! All you need are some songs and disc textures, and the app will do the rest.

Give the discs to yourself with this command:	/function infinite_music_discs_example_pack:give_all_discs
Or get a skeleton to shoot a creeper, the new discs are added to the creeper loot pool.
